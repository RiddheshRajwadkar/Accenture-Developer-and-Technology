Computational thinking is a structured problem-solving approach that starts with a problem and ends with a set of steps that can be followed by humans or computers to solve the problem.<br>
**Key elements involved in Computational Thinking**<br>
- Decomposition: Breaking down the problem into smaller parts
- Pattern Recognition: Analysing data to find connections and relationships.
