### Algorithmic Thinking
**Computational thinking**<br>
Computational thinking is a structured problem-solving approach that starts with a problem and ends with a set of steps that can be followed by humans or computers to solve the problem.<br>
**Key elements involved in Computational Thinking**<br>
- Decomposition: Breaking down the problem into smaller parts.
- Pattern Recognition: Analysing data to find connections and relationships.
- Abstraction: Identifying the key data and relationships to solve the problem.
- Algorithmic thinking: Designing a reproducible step-by-step process that solves the problem and produces desirable outputs.
