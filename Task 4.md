### Task 4: The Software Testing Life Cycle
#### What is Software Testing Life Circle(STLC)?
Software Testing LifeCycle is a conceptual framework and process model for describing all the activities involved in the process to ensure the software works as it was designed to, without any defects. And support the software team in correcting the defects.

**Major stages in STLC**
- Requirement Analysis
- Testing Planning
- Test Design
- Test Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Closeout

**To reduce risk and identify defects as early as possible, different levels of software testing are performed at different points in the development cycle:**

- Unit tests. A code-level check, performed by members of the development team, to see if individual components of code are working correctly.
- Integration tests. Tests of the connectivity and data transfer between unit tested code components or other integration points in the system. Also often done by the development team, but could also be done by a QA team.
- System tests. Also known as end-to-end testing, system tests are conducted to test the completed, fully integrated software application from a technical point of view, checking that each input leads to the correct output. Often done by a QA testing team at the end of each release cycle. Often referred to as SIT (system integration testing).
- Acceptance tests. Tests performed by a QA team or a team of representative end users from the client to test the usability and functionality from the end userâ€™s perspective.   Often referred to as UAT (user acceptance testing). Usually the last step before deployment to production and go-live.
- Regression tests. Systematic retesting of functionality that might have been affected by a modification made to other code to verify no unintended effects of the change. Usually performed by whoever did SIT or UAT testing
