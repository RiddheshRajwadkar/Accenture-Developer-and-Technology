### Task 2: The Software Development Life Cycle
#### What is Software Development Life Cycle?
##### SDLC is a conceptual framework and process model for describing all the activities involved in the process to create, deliver and maintain high-quality software.<br>
- **Major stages in SDLC are:**
  - Requirements gathering/extraction and analysis
  - Planning
  - Design
  - Building/Coding
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Operation
  - Support/Maintenance
#### Implementation of SDLC
##### SDLC is never implemented completely sequentially, it is implemented in an iterative and repetitive manner. Natable SDLC implementation are "Waterfall methodologies" and "Agile methodologies". Any methodologies chosen using SDLC ensure us that:
- Work is broken down into stages that are well defined, measurable, accountable, and manageable
- Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
- Risk is assessed and managed as appropriate at each stage
- Quality control/quality assurance processes can be implemented with the right resources at the right times in the process
- Key performance metrics and productivity metrics can be recorded, analysed, and compared at each stage
- Insights from analysis of performance and productivity metrics are fed back into the next iteration of the cycle so the overall process and product are improved
