### Task 2: The Software Development Life Cycle
#### What is the Software Development Life Cycle?
##### SDLC is a conceptual framework and process model for describing all the activities involved in the process of creating, delivering and maintaining high-quality software.<br>
**Major stages in SDLC are:**
  - Requirements gathering/extraction and analysis
  - Planning
  - Design
  - Building/Coding
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Operation
  - Support/Maintenance
#### Implementation of SDLC
##### SDLC is never implemented completely sequentially, it is implemented in an iterative and repetitive manner. Notable SDLC implementations are "Waterfall methodologies" and "Agile methodologies". Any methodologies chosen using SDLC ensure us that:
- Work is broken down into stages that are well-defined, measurable, accountable, and manageable
- Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
- Risk is assessed and managed as appropriate at each stage
- Quality control/quality assurance processes can be implemented with the right resources at the right times in the process
- Key performance metrics and productivity metrics can be recorded, analysed, and compared at each stage
- Insights from analysis of performance and productivity metrics are fed back into the next iteration of the cycle so the overall process and product are improved<br><br>

### Task 3:  Software Development Methodologies: Waterfall and Agile
#### Waterfall Methodology
<img src="https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/several-consecutive-phases-of-the-classical-waterfall-model.webp" alt="123" height="400px" width="1000px"><br><br>
Waterfall methodology originated in the 1950s and 1960s when the software development tools were very slow and cumbersome. Hence the strategy to reduce project and delivery risk was to spend a huge amount of time in the requirements definition, planning and design phases. It was named a waterfall because it looks like a waterfall on the timeline diagram.<br>
#### Advantages & Disadvantages
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :-: | :-: |
|Work planning and budget forecasts can be relatively accurate even over a span of years|Small tasks or details unfinished in one phase can hold up the whole process|
|Process is straightforward, relatively simple, easily communicated|Cumbersome and expensive to respond to significant changes in scope or design|
| It's very easy to know how far along a project is, and who is responsible at each stage|Each phase and its corresponding team are relatively disconnected from the others, with the customers (whose needs are ostensibly driving the design and functionality of the software) as far removed as possible from the requirements definition and design phases where their input is most needed|
|Scope creep is tightly managed or prevented|Large documentation overhead drives up cost and delivery time|

#### Agile Methodology

Agile methodology was finalized in 2001. In this model, the software is broken down into smaller sets of functionality, each of which is then designed, built, tested, and released in repeating waves or “sprints” in direct collaboration with the customer, who has input into each of those sprints, all along the development cycle.

**Agile implementation follows 4 key values**
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:-:|:-:|
|Designed with change in mind. Changes to scope and design are expected and easily accommodated by the process|Can get too responsive to frequent changes, with too much input from the customer. A good balance must be maintained|
|Easy and quick to pivot based on changing customer feedback |Less effective if the customer does not want to be a direct and active member of the team|
|Useful value is delivered frequently and repeatedly throughout the lifecycle, starting with delivering the MVP|Requires training team members and customers to best implement and utilise the Agile mindset and Agile cultural work processes|
|Faster to production deployment than with waterfall, with a generally lower overall risk profile and a higher ROI|Requires strong communication and teamwork skills to be effective|
