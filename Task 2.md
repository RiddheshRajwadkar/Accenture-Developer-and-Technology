### Task 2: The Software Development Life Cycle
#### What is the Software Development Life Cycle?
##### SDLC is a conceptual framework and process model for describing all the activities involved in the process of creating, delivering and maintaining high-quality software.<br>
**Major stages in SDLC are:**
  - Requirements gathering/extraction and analysis
  - Planning
  - Design
  - Building/Coding
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Operation
  - Support/Maintenance
#### Implementation of SDLC
##### SDLC is never implemented completely sequentially, it is implemented in an iterative and repetitive manner. Notable SDLC implementations are "Waterfall methodologies" and "Agile methodologies".<br> 
##### Any methodologies chosen using SDLC ensure us that:
- Work is broken down into stages that are well-defined, measurable, accountable, and manageable
- Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
- Risk is assessed and managed as appropriate at each stage
- Quality control/quality assurance processes can be implemented with the right resources at the right times in the process
- Key performance metrics and productivity metrics can be recorded, analysed, and compared at each stage
- Insights from analysis of performance and productivity metrics are fed back into the next iteration of the cycle so the overall process and product are improved<br><br>
