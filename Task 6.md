### Task 6: Code Debugging
The concept of code debugging goes back to the earliest days of computer science when computers were room sized machine and used vacuum tubes and electromechanical relays to switch between "1" and "0" instead of electronic.<br><br>
**There are three categories of common bugs or errors in computer code:**

- Logic errors. Errors in the logic of the algorithm itself. Not strictly speaking an error in the code itself so much as an error in the thinking behind the code. Common logic errors include missing or unusual conditions under which a THEN or an ELSE 
- should occur but the code does not include them because the algorithm was incompletely specified.
- Syntax errors. Errors in use of programming language vocabulary and grammar when writing code. These errors prevent the computer from correctly parsing and understanding the code as written, so the code will not run. Common syntax errors include 
- misspelling function or variable names and leaving out required parentheses or semicolons.
- Run-time errors. Errors that occur during the execution of the code. Either the code will run but the output is wrong, or the code stops running because a necessary condition doesnâ€™t currently exist, like a file is missing or a database is inaccessible.
